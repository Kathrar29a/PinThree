#Can Use the USB ports defined by your OS for the two STM32 boards or
# ports: /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyACM1
#USING SERIAL NUMBERS INSTEAD OF CHAINS
#  Board 0 has serial number 0, Board 1 has serial number 1.
#  This is convenient if your OS tends to reassign the serial port.
#  MPF will automatically address the correct board even if the ports
#     are swapped.

#For multiple CobraPin boards in a game, you will either have to give
#  the STM32 boards on the second CobraPin board new serial numbers
#  (10 and 11 are suggested for the 2nd board since 2 is used by the
#  CobraPin Xpansion Board)
#  <OR> Use the chains section to assign a port to a board number.
#  Mixing these up could cause blown FETs, coils, and fuses. Proceed
#  with caution. Test without coil power and use the yellow coil LEDs
#  for feedback.
#chains:
   #0: /dev/ttyACM0
   #1: /dev/ttyACM1

psus:
  default:
    # Gives the capacitors extra time to recharge after firing a coil
    #  and eases the load on the power supply. Doesn't affect autofire
    #  devices like flippers, pops, slings.
